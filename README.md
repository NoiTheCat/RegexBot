# RegexBot
RegexBot is a standalone Discord moderation bot that makes use of the
[Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) library.

The goal of this project is to provide a bot that can truly fit your unique needs in managing Discord server.
To that end, many aspects of the bot's behavior can be configured and fine-tuned, down to how it responds to
rules that you have implemented.

Are you satisfied with your current bot but wish that you could change *that one thing* to better suit your
needs? This project is an answer to that.
