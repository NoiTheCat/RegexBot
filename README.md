# RegexBot
RegexBot is a standalone Discord moderation bot that makes use of the
[Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) library.

The goal of this project is to provide a bot that can truly fit your unique needs in managing Discord server. To that end, many aspects of the bot's behavior can be configured and fine-tuned, ensuring that the bot acts exactly as you want it to act.

Are you satisfied with your current bot but wish that you could change *that one thing* to better suit your needs? This project is an answer to that.

Granted, progress on this project so far has followed the needs of one Discord server that makes heavy use of it, so its current feature set may be limited. Feel free to send a pull request or submit an issue.
