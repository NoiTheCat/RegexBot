# Kerobot
**This project is a major work in progress and is unusable in its current state. Not all features may be present.**

Kerobot is a Discord moderation bot that takes some inspiration from Reddit's Automoderator. It provides a number of features to assist in watching over a busy server. Its configuration allows for a very high level of flexibility, ensuring that the bot behaves in accordance to the exact needs of your server.

### Feature overview
* Create rules based on regular expression patterns
  * Follow up with custom responses ranging from sending a DM to disciplinary action
* Create pattern-based triggers to provide information and fun to your users
  * Adjustable rate limits per-trigger to prevent spam
  * Specify multiple different responses to display at random when triggered
  * Make things interesting by setting triggers that only activate at random
* Individual rules and triggers can be whitelisted or blacklisted per-user, per-channel, or per-role
  * Exemptions to these filters can be applied for additional flexibility

## Documentation
Coming soon.
