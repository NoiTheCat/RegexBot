# What is RegexBot?

You may already have your server more or less how you want it, with all the bots that fulfill your
needs. But, have you ever wished to be able to modify *one little thing* in your bot's behavior and
make it perfect?

This project is an answer to that. RegexBot is a moderation tool that allows all aspects of its
behavior to be defined and modified through its configuration. This means that you can customize
the bot and have it be perfectly suited for your own purposes.
